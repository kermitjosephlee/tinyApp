# Tiny App :: The URL Squisher

    This project was created to show that we played around with some
    things like...

    - express server (GETting & POSTing)
    - node and nodemon (when we got tired of constantly resetting the server for testing)
    - resetting nodemon
    - bcrypt
    - objects - creating, entering and handling data, for-in looping
    - EJS templating

    It is NOT the prettiest thing but it works. Enjoy.
    
    LHL Note: I had issues with my screenshots. Sorry.
